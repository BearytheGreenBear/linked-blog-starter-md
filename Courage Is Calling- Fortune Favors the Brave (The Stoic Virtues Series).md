### Highlights & Notes

- “Virtue” can seem old-fashioned. Yet virtue—arete—translates to something very simple and very timeless: Excellence. Moral. Physical. Mental. In the ancient world, virtue was comprised of four key components. Courage. Temperance. Justice. Wisdom.
- Conversely, the greatest moments in human history all share one thing—whether
- The bravery of ordinary men and women. People who did what needed to be done. People who said, “If not me, then who?”
- “To each,” Winston Churchill would say, “there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing, unique to them and fitted to their talents. What a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared or unqualified for that which could have been their finest hour.” It’s more accurate to say that life has many of these moments, many such taps on the shoulder.
- First, we are called to rise above our fear and cowardice. Next, we are called to bravery, over the elements, over the odds, over our limitations. Finally, we are called to heroism, perhaps for only just a single magnificent moment, when we are called to do something for someone other than ourselves.
- So if we wish to be great, we must first learn how to conquer fear, or at least rise above it in the moments that matter.
- This fear was strong, as it is in every person when they consider uncharted waters, when they consider blowing up their lives to do something new or different. When everyone tells you that you’ll fail, that you’re wrong, how could you not listen? It’s a terrible paradox: You’d have to be crazy not to hear them when they tell you you’re crazy.
- Indeed, in the so-called Hero’s Journey, the “call to adventure” is followed in almost all cases by what? The refusal of the call. Because it’s too hard, too scary, because they must obviously have picked the wrong person.
- There is nothing worth doing that is not scary. There is no one who has achieved greatness without wrestling with their own doubts, anxieties, limitations, and demons.
- Today, each of us receives our own call. To service. To take a risk. To challenge the status quo. To run toward while others run away. To rise above our station. To do what people say is impossible.
- “Be scared. You can’t help that,” William Faulkner put it. “But don’t be afraid.”
- Who does good work when they are afraid? Who can see clearly when they’re afraid? Who can help others? How can you love when you’re afraid? How can you do anything when you’re afraid?
- “False Evidence Appearing Real.” In sobriety circles, as they work to comfort and assuage the worries that hold an addict back from making changes or trying new things, that’s what they call F.E.A.R. False impressions that feel real.
- Life is still unpredictable. There is so much we don’t know. Of course we’re easily alarmed. Of course we’re at the whim of our fears and doubts. The only way through is to attack that fear. Logically. Clearly. Empathetically.
- At the root of most fear is what other people will think of us.
- The paradox of course is that almost everything new, everything impressive, everything right, was done over the loud objections of the status quo. Most of what is beloved now was looked down on at the time of its creation or adoption by people who now pretend that never happened. We often lack the ability or the willingness to see that their objections are just a hump that must be gotten over.
- “There are always more of them before they are counted.” The obstacles, the enemies, the critics—they are not as numerous as you think. It’s an illusion they want you to believe.
- We fear that something bad might happen. We fear things not working out. We fear the consequences. We fear what people might think. But what, where, when, how, who? That we cannot answer, because we haven’t actually looked into it. We haven’t actually defined what so worries us.
- For Seneca, the unexpected blows land most heavily and painfully. So by expecting, by defining, by wrestling with what can happen, we are making it less scary and less dangerous at the same time.
- We need also to cultivate the courage to think about all the things that could happen, the things that are unpleasant to think about, the unusual, the unexpected, the unlikely. It’s not just a matter of reducing our anxiety about exaggerated uncertainties, it’s also about finding certainty in the unknowns—the risk factors, what goes bump in the night, the plans of the enemy, the things that can and will go wrong. Nothing human should be foreign to us. Nothing possible should be alien.
- Don’t worry about whether things will be hard. Because they will be. Instead, focus on the fact that these things will help you. This is why you needn’t fear them.
- If it were easy, everyone would do it. If everyone did it, how valuable would it be? The whole point is that it’s hard. The risk is a feature, not a bug.
- It’s when we imagine everything, when we catastrophize endlessly, that we are miserable and most afraid. When we focus on what we have to carry and do? We are too busy to worry, too busy working. There is plenty for you here right now. That’s why the Stoics talked about sticking with “first impressions.” Just what you see. What’s here. Not everything else that may or may not someday be related to it.
- We can’t forget that all the energy we spend fearing that we’ll make it worse is energy not spent making it better.
- Apply yourself to thinking through difficulties—hard times can be softened, tight squeezes widened, and heavy loads made lighter for those who can apply the right pressure.
- It’s very easy to judge. It’s very hard to know. To know what another person is going through. To know what their reasons are. What interrelated risks they are trying to manage, who and what they are trying to protect.
- No one can truly understand what it would be like to occupy a different time and place, with different assumptions, assumptions shared by everyone you’ve ever met and everything you’ve ever read. But it’s also pretty clear: What would you have done back then? As Khrushchev said, you’d be doing the same thing you’re doing today. Don’t bother with “What would I do in their shoes?” Ask: “What am I doing now?” In your own life. With your own fears.
- We go through life in two ways. We choose between effective truths: that we have the ability to change our situation, or that we are at the mercy of the situations in which we find ourselves. We can rely on luck . . . or cause and effect.
- If we don’t believe in anything, it becomes very hard to find anything worth believing in. We make our nihilism true, just as we do when we buy the lie that we have no agency; or alternatively, that while we don’t control what has happened, we do control how we happen to respond. If you fear that there isn’t anything you can do, chances are you will do nothing. You will also be nothing. A protected, self-justifying nothing.
- The brave don’t despair. They believe. They are not cynical, they care. They think there is stuff worth dying for—that good and evil exist. They know that life has problems but would rather be part of the solution than a bystander.
- We don’t want to offend. We don’t want trouble. We don’t want to lose our access. Or our power. Or our pension. Or our privileges. We tell ourselves we can pull off the high-wire act.
- All growth is a leap in the dark. If you’re afraid of that, you’ll never do anything worthwhile. If you take counsel of your fears, you’ll never take that step, make that leap.
- The fear you feel is a sign. If courage is never required in your life, you’re living a boring life.
- So many choices. Few of them easy. None of them clear. Scary choices, torturing you, as Shakespeare said, “like a phantasma, or a hideous dream.” We tell ourselves we’re thinking, that we’re weighing our options, that we’re making progress. In truth, we are paralyzed with fear. Overwhelmed by options. By second guesses. By that hatred of making mistakes. So what we’re really doing is making ourselves miserable. We tell ourselves it’s about options . . . really it’s paralysis by analysis. All the while, somebody or someone else is making progress.
- As the song goes, even if you choose not to decide—even if you put things off—you still have made a choice. You are voting for the status quo. You are voting to let them decide. You are voting to give up your own agency.
- There are things worse than dying. Living with what we had to do to keep living, for one. Regretting that lost opportunity to have been a hero. The hellish existence of a world run by cowards.
- We are fragile creatures. Nothing can change that. You’re a fool if you think staying on the good side of bad people is a safe bet. The future you seem to be willing to defer anything to ensure? Nothing can guarantee it. This moment, the present you’re neglecting—whether it’s an opportunity to do something risky and fun, or the call to do something harrowing but right—is all you have.
- It’s worth remembering that most people die in bed. Getting up and getting active is much safer!
- All certainty is uncertain. You’re not safe. You never will be. No one is. In putting safety above everything, we actually put ourselves in danger. Of being forgotten. Of never coming close. Of being complicit.
- No rule is perfect, but this one works: Our fears point us, like a self-indicting arrow, in the direction of the right thing to do. One part of us knows what we ought to do, but the other part reminds us of the inevitable consequences. Fear alerts us to danger, but also to opportunity. If it wasn’t scary, everyone would do it. If it was easy, there wouldn’t be any growth in it. That tinge of self-preservation is the pinging of the metal detector going off. We may have found something.
- By definition, each of us is original. Our DNA has never existed before on this planet. No one has ever had our unique set of experiences. Yet what do we do with this heritage? We push it away. We choose not to be ourselves. We choose to go along, to not raise any eyebrows.
- To stand up would be to stand out. It was to make yourself a target. It was to be different and thus alone.
- Out of fear, we conform. Out of fear, we don’t do what’s right. We mute ourselves. We don’t even want other people to be themselves, because it makes us uncomfortable.
- There is no change, no attempt, no reach that does not look strange to someone. There’s almost no accomplishment that is possible without calling some attention on yourself. To gamble on yourself is to risk failure. To do it in public is to risk humiliation. Anyone who tries to leave their comfort zone has to know that. Yet we’d almost rather die than be uncomfortable. The comedian Jerry Seinfeld once noted that people rank public speaking as worse than the fear of death, which means, quite insanely, that at a funeral the average person would rather be in the casket than delivering the eulogy.
- It’s ironic, the Stoics would say, that for all our selfish cares about ourselves, we seem to value other people’s opinions about us more than our own.
- Even if you don’t come from a famous family. Even if you come from a persecuted minority, you come from fighters and survivors.
- When we are afraid, we can look up at those who came before us. We can visit the monuments they erected. We can read the documents they wrote. Because this is our tradition.
- Historically, the Stoics were strong. And brave. And did their duty—without complaint, without hesitation. With courage, they carried the load, and willingly did so for others when it was necessary. But it’s a mistake to assume that they were somehow superhuman, that they never struggled, never wavered, never needed for anything. They had to—as we all do—ask for help when they needed it. And they were not afraid to do it, either. Because sometimes that’s the strongest and bravest thing to do.
- We are afraid to open up. We are scared to share. We don’t want anyone to know how we’re feeling inside . . . and so all of us feel more alone.
- If everyone believed this, if fear ruled supreme, not only would those expressions become effective truths, but good would never triumph over evil, new would never break through the status quo, and nothing would ever be improved.
- “The intervention of human will in the chain of events has something irrevocable about it,” de Gaulle had written before the war. “Responsibility presses down with such weight that few men are capable of bearing it alone. That is why the greatest qualities of intelligence do not suffice. Undoubtedly intelligence helps, and instinct pushes one, but in the last resource a decision has a moral element.”
- That is the thing about courage: Just like fear, it is contagious.
- “I discovered that the world should be divided not into good and bad people but into cowards and non-cowards,” he wrote. “Ninety-five percent of cowards are capable of the vilest things, lethal things, at the mildest threat.” When we ask about courage, we are thinking about it precisely wrong. It’s not our question to ask. For it is we who are being asked the question.
- For thousands of years human beings have found themselves here, forced to ask themselves another famous question, adapted from the rabbi Hillel: “If not me, then who? If not now, then when?” Or as John Lewis put it: “If not us, then who?”
- Each of us has our own skills, our own set of experiences and insights. We each receive our call. If we don’t answer it, then we deprive the world of something. Our failure of courage ripples out beyond us, into the lives of other people.
- Although fear can be explained away, it’s far more effective to replace it. With what? Competence. With training. With tasks. With a job that needs to be done.
- As Epictetus says, the goal when we experience adversity is to be able to say, “This is what I’ve trained for, for this is my discipline.”
- Sometimes the best place to start is somewhere small.
- How do you get over all that fear? All those reasons not to do whatever it is you set out to do? In the words of the decorated Navy SEAL Jocko Willink, to get over the fear, you go. You just do. You leap into the dark. It is the only way. Because if you don’t, what looms? Failure. Regret. Shame. A lost opportunity. Any hope of moving forward.
- In a sense, it’s strange that we even admire this. Shouldn’t that be the norm? Isn’t that our basic duty as people? To know the truth and not say the truth . . . this is to betray the truth. You may escape guilt by staying silent, but there is no excuse. You’re culpable. You’re a coward. It may be that no one wants to hear the truth, and they may very well be scared to hear it, but you can’t be afraid to say it.
- There’s a great expression: Whatever you’re not changing, you’re choosing. Later, you’re going to wish you did something. Whether it’s leaving an abusive relationship or starting a company, don’t fight it—decide it. Now.
- The well-behaved rarely make history. Had these men and women been a little more conciliatory, a little more willing to accept the role expected of them, had they cared a little bit more about what other people thought, were they a little bit easier to deter, there wouldn’t have been an independent stand to take in the first place.
- Once the event is underway, everything else comes naturally. Fulfilling your responsibilities. Putting one foot in front of the other. You drop out of college, then throw yourself into your new career. You file the divorce paperwork and begin rebuilding your life. You walk into the office of the SEC to make your complaint. You’ll be too busy to be afraid. Momentum starts working for you—not against you.
- When we marvel at people’s courage or are intimidated by it, we often miss that it wasn’t some enormous planned-out thing. It began with a simple decision. It began with a leap.
- We can’t just hope to be brave when it counts. It has to be something we cultivate. No athlete just expects to hit the game-winning shot—they practice it thousands of times. They take that shot in scrimmages, in pickup games, alone in the gym as they count down the clock in their head. There is that clichéd bit of advice: Do one thing each day that scares you. As it happens, it’s not bad. How do you expect to do the big things that scare you—that scare others—if you haven’t practiced them? How can you trust that you’ll step forward when the stakes are high when you regularly don’t do that even when the stakes are low? So we must test ourselves. We make courage a habit.
- It was an answer that captured the philosophy by which this warrior—and every warrior before and since—lives their life: A philosophy of offense. Of initiative. Of intimidating the enemy rather than being intimidated, of striking fear—striking, period—rather than being struck by it.
- To use another phrase from Martin Luther King Jr., when we straighten our backs, we might be beaten—but we can’t be ridden.
- We cannot tolerate abuse, constraints, or injustice. We can’t hide from our problems. We can only step to them. Submission is no cure. Nor can we expect outrages to magically go away on their own. We must draw the line, somewhere—if not right now, then very soon. We must demand our sovereignty. Insist on it.
- Because courage, like fear, is contagious. One person who knows what they are doing, who isn’t afraid, who has a plan is enough to reinforce an outnumbered army, to buck up a broken system, to calm chaos where it has taken root.
- This is the truth of that saying we talked about earlier come to life: One man with courage makes a majority.
- This is the rule: You decided to go. Now you have to own what happens. No excuses. No exceptions. That you carry your own weight in this world, that is all we ask. That you own your own actions. Certainly when you’re a leader.
- Fortune favors the bold. Fortune favors the brave. It favors the big plans. It favors the risk-taking.
- We want people to grow up. Get real. Get over the fairy tales. But without this belief, without the courage to go on despite the condescension, the criticism, the futility of it, where would we be?
- We won’t always be successful, but we have to try. We can’t harden our hearts or turn up our televisions. We don’t need to wait for some enormous moment. It’s about what we do every day—for ourselves, for other people.
- The freedom of the modern world, the freedom of your success—this is not freedom not to care. It is not permission to be indifferent. Yes, you have a lot going on. Yes, most of the evil in the world is not your fault. Still, you don’t get to close your ears to the screams of an innocent person downstairs.
- As Gies explains, we must have the courage to help, even if it’s a hopeless battle. “Any attempt at action is better than inaction,” she reflected years later. “An attempt can go wrong, but inaction inevitably results in failure.”
- One man can just as easily lead himself—and the majority—right off a cliff. So it is important we understand that courage, as a virtue, must be weighed against the equally essential virtue of moderation. Indeed, Aristotle used courage to illustrate the concept of temperance. Courage, he said, was the midpoint between two vices—cowardice being the best known, but recklessness being equally dangerous.
- That’s what Marcus Aurelius strove to be: “neither rash nor hesitant—nor bewildered nor at a loss . . . not obsequious—but not aggressive or paranoid either.”
- Although agency is something that every person is born with, few of us choose to assert it. We accept the limitations that other people put on us. We listen to what they tell us is feasible or not. We, upon reviewing the odds, make them an effective truth. What fear does is deprive you of power by making you think you don’t have any. If you don’t believe you can do something, it’s not only unlikely that you can do it, it’s guaranteed that you won’t even try. Which is why we need more people to break out of this mentality.
- Few men of accomplishment, da Vinci noted, got there by things happening to them. No, he said, they are what has happened.
- Are these moments of ferocious intensity cool or impressive? No, it would be better if they never had to happen. No good guy should ever have to draw a gun on a bad guy. No one should ever have to defend themselves as a consequence of doing the right thing. The world does not care about “should.”
- Even Gandhi, a man of incredible gentleness and restraint, knew there was a line that must sometimes be crossed. “Where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence,” he said, “I would advise violence.”
- As that mouse might attest, no species survives long without a will to protect itself. Without bravery, without the warrior ethos, no one—and no nation—survives long enough. There are plenty of brave pacifists out there, but even they understand at some level that their idealism is feasible only because others are willing to be pragmatic in their place.
- In his dialogue with Laches, Socrates asks for a definition of courage. The answer he gets is a good one: “Courage is a sort of endurance of the soul.”
- Fear gives us no shortage of reasons why we can’t do any or all of those things: It’s too hard. It’s too dangerous. The odds are too high. The orders don’t make sense. The leader should have put me in charge. Courage cuts through the noise. It reminds you what the situation calls for. It reminds you what you signed up for.
- Duty is not just doing what you swore in your oath, or not doing what is proscribed by law, it is what is demanded of us as decent human beings. Our duty is to do the right thing—right now.
- The history of appeasement and procrastination show us: The bill comes due eventually, with interest attached.
- Where would we be without people brave enough to challenge the odds? If every entrepreneur, activist, and general listened to the predictions, what kind of world would this be?
- Still, there is no escaping: Sometimes we must be brave enough to defy the odds, but we do this only when there is a real chance of success. And we do it rarely, when we have no other choice.
- Here, in the middle of this difficult time—personally, professionally, politically—we can find strength in the examples of the past. We can let great deeds and inspiring words steel our resolve and harden our commitment.
- Man is pushed by drives. But he is pulled by values. Viktor Frankl
- True heroism shames us. Humbles us. It moves us beyond reason—because it came from something beyond reason. Which is why we worship it so.
- If courage—moral and physical—is the act of putting your ass on the line, then the definition of the heroic is very simple: It is risking oneself for someone else. It’s putting it on the line not just for your own benefit but for the benefit of someone, something, some larger cause.
- “If you had any knowledge of the noble things of life,” Leonidas told Xerxes, “you would refrain from coveting others’ possessions; but for me to die for Greece is better than to be the sole ruler over the people of my race.”
- This was not quite true, for even the stand of those few owes a debt first to the three hundred Spartans. It’s not a stretch to argue that all the accomplishments of Western civilization, from the Renaissance to the American Revolution, would not have happened were it not for the sacrifice at Thermopylae.
- It is almost offensively clichéd now to use the phrase “Freedom isn’t free.” Nonetheless, it is true.
- Gates of Fire, the epic historical novel of this battle by Steven Pressfield, is today passed from soldier to soldier, person to person, as a kind of tribute to that example.
